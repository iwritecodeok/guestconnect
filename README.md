# guestConnect

We want to see your implementation of this process. More specifically, your code should:
Have some sort of structure or object for working with template messages that have placeholders/variables (i.e. firstName, lastName,
roomNumber, etc.) embedded in them

- [x] Load in message template information from a JSON file that you will have had created. Structure the file however you see fit
- [x] Load in guest and company information from the JSON files that we have provided
- [x] Support a greeting variable that will change based on the time of day (e.g. "Good morning" / "Good afternoon" / "Good evening")
- [x] Allow the user to specify which guest and which company should be used to populate template messages.
- [] Allow the user to either select one of the message templates that was loaded in from the JSON file or to enter in a new message template.

- [x] Generate a final message output that is a result of populating the specified variables of the message template with the correct values from the other data

You can use any programming language you like. We care more about how you approach the problem than what specific languages you are
proficient in. No GUI element is required, but feel free to expand in that direction if it suits you.
